creating a React application that supports multiple languages. 
The application should allow users to change the language setting, and the content should dynamically update based on the selected language.

Requirements:
1. Implement multi-language support for at least three languages (e.g., English, Hindi). 
2. You can use language files or libraries like react-i18next for this purpose.
3. The application should have at least two pages or components with text content (e.g., Home and About).
4. Implement a language setting feature that allows users to switch between languages.
5. When the user changes the language, the content of the entire application should update to the selected language without requiring a page refresh.
6. Provide a clear and user-friendly way for users to change the language (e.g., dropdown menu, flags, or buttons).
7. Add a default language setting for the application to load with (e.g., English).
Ensure that the project is well-organized and follows best practices in React development.
